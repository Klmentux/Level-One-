    <dt>How to prepare Fried Rice</dt>
    <dd>To prepare fried rice, start by parboiling your rice and set it aside to drain. In a separate pot, boil your chicken or any preferred protein with seasoning like salt, onion, curry, and seasoning cubes, then reserve the stock. Heat some vegetable oil in a pan, add chopped onions, garlic (optional), and vegetables such as diced carrots, green peas, sweet corn, and green beans. Stir-fry them for a few minutes so they remain crisp and colorful. Add a bit of curry powder and thyme to bring out the fried rice flavor.

Next, pour in some of the chicken stock and allow it to simmer gently. Add the parboiled rice into the pan and stir carefully so everything mixes evenly while keeping the grains separate. Continue cooking on low heat until the rice absorbs the flavor and moisture. Finally, you can add your cooked chicken or fried liver pieces to the rice and stir lightly. Serve hot, preferably with chicken, fried plantain, or salad for a complete meal. </dd>

How to prepare Plantain
</dt>

<dd>Start by peeling the plantain. Use a knife to cut off both ends, make a light slit on the skin, and gently remove the peel. Cut the plantain into slices â€” you can slice them round, slanted, or into cubes depending on your preference. After slicing, sprinkle a little salt over the plantain and mix gently so the salt spreads evenly.

Next, place a frying pan on medium heat and add enough vegetable oil for deep or shallow frying. Once the oil is hot, gently place the plantain slices into the oil, making sure they are not stacked on top of each other. Fry until the bottom side turns golden brown, then flip and fry the other side. When both sides are golden and cooked, remove the plantain from the oil and place it on paper towels to drain excess oil. Serve hot with rice, beans, eggs, or enjoy it alone.</dd>
